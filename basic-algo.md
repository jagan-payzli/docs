# Basic Algorithms
```
1. print all even numbers between 1 - 1000
2. print all odd numbers between 1 - 1000
3. check a number is prime number or not
4. print all prime numbers between 1 - 1000
5. a & b are two variables, check if b is divisible by a or not 
6. a = 5 & b = 23, find the remainder
7. print tables of any number (print table of 18)
8. [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] this is an array, add all numbers of this array
9. find the sum and product of all numbers between 1 to 100.
10. find all the multiple of 9 between 1 to 1000
11. find all the divisibles of 1000
12. find factors of 84
13. print length of an array. ex - [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
14. count how many characters in "count me" this string
15. segregate uppercase and lowercase character from a string. ex- "We are a non-profit dedicated to bring affordable Tech Education to underprivileged girls in India"

Q 16. create a function which will return the menu for the given day

monday: "Dal + Rice"
tuesday: "Roti + lady's finger"
wednesday: "Chicken curry + Rice"
thursday: "Rajma + Rice"
friday: "Egg curry + Rice + Roti"
saturday: "Fish curry + Rice"
sunday: "Poori + kheer + Gulabjamun"

const getMenu = (day) => {
// write your code here
// return recipe_name_for_the_day
}

const recipe_name = getMenu("friday");
console.log("menu for fiday is ", recipe_name)
```
